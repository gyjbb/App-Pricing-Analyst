# App-Pricing-Analyst
This is a project that analyzes App pricing strategies in order to provide suggestions for App developers. 

The data we used is gathered from Kaggle, comprsing name, category, size, version and other detailed information of more than 10000 Apps in Google Plat Store. Through the feature engineering and model building of our analysis of this dataset, we hope to gain more insights about the price distributions of the Apps and make optimal price prediction for newly developed Apps, helping the Apps reach more potential audience.
